# Algorithm Analysis

## Time Complexity

### Graph Construction
- O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Adjacency Matrix Calculation
- O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices.

### Spectral Clustering
- O(V^2) or O(V^3), depending on the specific implementation and optimization techniques.

### Graph Visualization
- Depends on the number of nodes and edges but is typically not the dominating factor.

## Space Complexity

### Graph Representation
- O(V + E) for the Karate Club graph.

### Adjacency Matrix
- O(V^2).

### Spectral Clustering
- Depends on the implementation and the space required for matrices during eigendecomposition.

## Overall Analysis

### Scalability
- Spectral clustering may be computationally expensive for large graphs due to eigendecomposition.

### Input Sensitivity
- Effective for discovering non-linearly separable clusters.

### Parameter Sensitivity
- Choice of the number of clusters (k) impacts performance.

### Advantages
- Robust for complex geometries and non-convex clusters.

### Drawbacks
- Less efficient for very large datasets.

## Conclusion

Spectral clustering is a powerful technique for clustering graphs and non-convex structures, providing meaningful results in various applications.
